## Introducing the PAM stack

The PAM stack is a new framework for creating sustainable development teams.

## What does PAM stand for?

The three pillars of the PAM stack are: process, abstractions, and mentorship. They represent the different ways that teams can make simple changes to have a dramatic impact on the success of their developers and on the inclusion of junior developers.

## Process

Process doesn't have to be a burden. Process is all about defining our expectations of ourselves and our teammates, measure the effects of of our work, and then iterating on those expectations. The keys to process are to: plan, train, execute, measure, and review.

In this section of this repository, we've included the following free materials:

* Sample process plans
* Checklists and other assistive materials
* Articles about how to introduce or improve process

## Abstractions

It is possible to structure an application in such a way that it is more conducive to being maintained by developers of a variety of experience levels. This includes everything from the scaffolding and execution of the project and the build system, to the architecture of the application and the ways we convert visual designs to code.

In this section of this repository, we've included the following free materials:

* Lists of inclusive architectural approaches and technologies
* Articles about how to implement an inclusive architecture

## Mentorship

Developers that have mentors perform and are promoted at significantly higher rates than their peers. Additionally, mentorship can raise team morale, improve retention, promote a positive team culture, and improve outcomes for customers. Mentorship has positive career effects for the mentors as well!

In this section of this repository, we've included the following free materials:

* Plans and checklists about how to structure mentorship meetings
* Articles about additional ways to create a mentorship culture
